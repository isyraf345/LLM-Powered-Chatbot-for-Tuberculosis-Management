It has \nafflicted kings and queens, poets and politicians, \nrevolutionaries and writers, activists and actors. \nMost of its victims, however, are poor, marginalised or \nmalnourished, and the out-of-pocket costs associated \nwith treating TB expose them to financial hardship \nor drive them further into poverty. TB is the definitive \ndisease of deprivation.
